            "When you chat with the Gemini chatbot,1 you basically write prompts. This whitepaper focuses on writing prompts for the Gemini model within Vertex AI or by using the API. We will look into the various prompting techniques to help you getting started and share tips and best practices to become a prompting expert.\n",

            " Prompt engineering is the process of designing high-quality prompts that guide LLMs to produce accurate outputs. This process involves tinkering to find the best prompt, optimizing prompt length, and evaluating a prompt’s writing style and structure in relation to the task. When prompt engineering, you will start by choosing a model.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Gemini temperature control can be understood in a similar way to the softmax function used in machine learning. A low temperature setting mirrors a low softmax temperature (T), emphasizing a single, preferred temperature with high certainty. Temperatures close to the max tend to create more random output. As temperature gets higher and higher, all tokens become equally likely to be the next predicted token. The higher top-K, the more creative and varied the model’s output.\n",
            "\n",
            "At extreme settings of one sampling configuration value, that one sampling setting either cancels out other configuration settings or becomes irrelevant. As a general starting point, a temperature of .2, top-P of .95, and top-K of 30 will give you relatively coherent results that can be creative but not excessively so. If your task always has a single correct answer (e.g., answering a math problem), start with a temperature. of 0.\n",
            "\n",
            "When creating prompts for AI models, it is helpful to provide examples. Examples are especially useful when you want to steer the model to a certain output structure or pattern. When zero-shot doesn’t work, you can provide demonstrations or examples in the prompt, which leads to “one-shot” and “few- shot” prompting.\n",
            "\n",
            "System, contextual and role prompting are all techniques used to guide how LLMs generate text. System prompting sets the overall context and purpose for the language model. Contextual prompting provides specific details or background information relevant to the current conversation or task. Role prompting assigns a specific character or identity for the model to adopt.\n",

            "System prompts can be useful for generating output that meets specific requirements. The name ‘system prompt’ actually stands for ‘providing an additional task to the system’ For example, you could use a system prompt to generate a code snippet that is compatible with a specific programming language. Role prompting is a technique in prompt engineering that involves assigning a specific role to the gen AI model.\n",
